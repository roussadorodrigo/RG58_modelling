## Project's Main Goal: 
Find a way to mathematically describe the behaviour of the RG58 Coaxial Cable, considering it a Linear Time-Invariant System so that it's possible to simulate how it affects
a signal.

## Project's Current State: 
Finished and evaluated, currently writting the final report for it.

## Project's History:

### Phase I:
Assuming a loseless cable, evaluate the effect it has on the input signal (only in terms of phase shifting).

### Phase II:
Assuming, now, a cable that has losses, find the H(w) of the cable and show how much the c1, c2 and c3 coefficients affect it.

### Phase III:
Confirm the results with lab experiments and refine the model obtained on phase II.
